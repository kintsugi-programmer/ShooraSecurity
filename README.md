## Intro 
- this is advanced antivirus
- engine
- logic

## Req
Prog Lang

- Fun Fact: One antivirus always detect other antivirus as virus,as antivirus is also a data miner too....

### How it works
- when a file is fully inserted( not when transfers ) in pc ,antivirus will open file in Binary code,stores in engine
- and will check with database of 8bit binaries of virus
- if block 70%+ match => Declare virus
### How antivirus realtime engine works
- contineous monitor the system input and output data
- in new, hash check
- large to large database
- less resources
- fast ways
### what is virus

- junk file cleaning
  - junk in ram,gpu

## how it interact in pc
- scan quick default c drive or full scan
- algo
  - open dir of c drive
  - store in dictionery
  - recursive dictionary store
  - when detect virus,instant delete ,but when attach to data,filequarantine
  - store doc in other,then delete virus
  - works only at sleep mode,low graphics
- many dumb antivirus just delete the virus and data loss to
- realtime monitor processes ( datamine,etc)
  - but then low ram useage
  - way1
    - during opening file
  - way2
    - during opening folder
