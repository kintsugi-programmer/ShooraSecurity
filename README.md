# Antivirus Development
It's a advanced antivirus development with Engine, OOPS and Custom Libraries



### What is Antivirus
- Antivirus working( normal people just think it just stop/clear virus)
- clear infected file from computer

*Fun Fact: One antivirus always detect other antivirus as virus,as antivirus is also a data miner too....*
### How it works
- when a file is fully inserted( not when transfers ) in pc ,antivirus will open file in Binary code,stores in engine
- and will check with database of 8bit binaries of virus
- if block 70%+ match => Declare virus
### How antivirus realtime engine works
- continuous monitor the system input and output data
- in new, hash check
- large to large database
- less resources
- fast ways
### what is virus
- direct attack
- infect and harms the computer

*Virus != Malware != Malicious File*
### what is malware
- bind virus with any file, include Malicious code
### what is malicious code
- malicious files eg: image,ico,txt etc.
### type of virus
- tojans
- worms
- self replicating,even to replicate in pendrive
- data mining
- etc.

## usage
- virus detection and removal
- system analysis
- malware removal ( diff from virus)
- file quarantine
- threat identification ( identify, slow the infection )
- online security
  - wrong website
  - uncontrolled access
  - js script to mine data,cookies and decrypt
  - phishing, decoys in middle of login
- data protection
  - separate se quarantine
- junk file cleaning
  - junk in ram,gpu

## how it interacts in pc
- scan quick default c drive or full scan
- algo
  - open dir of c drive
  - store in dictionary
  - recursive dictionary store
  - when detect virus,instant delete ,but when attach to data,filequarantine
  - store doc in other,then delete virus
  - works only at sleep mode,low graphics
- many dumb antivirus just delete the virus and data loss to
- realtime monitor processes ( datamine,etc)
  - but then low ram usage
  - way1
    - during opening file
  - way2
    - during opening folder
